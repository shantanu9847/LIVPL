# LIVPL
Lorentz invariance Violation search using Profile Likelihood
This repository contains codes using to search for linear and quadratic Lorentz invariance violation based on arXiv:2411.09248
code3_pl.py is the code for linear LIV while code3_second.py is the code for quadratic LIV. time_lag_data.txt shows the data used for the analysis.
